I've now released my first proper mod thats actually worth downloading!\n\n---- Cycle ----\n\nCycle adds menstruation and woohoo risk as problems your sims must deal with. Trying for babies is no longer so easy, and having a night of ecstasy with your partner is no longer so safe. Use caution to avoid unwanted rug rats or carefully track your sim's fertility in order start a family.",

I thought I said you needed to download both, but I guess I wasn't clear enough for about 40% of you.\nCome back and download the actual mod you numbskull. :)",
